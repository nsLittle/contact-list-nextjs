## Contact List

This project was created by Mutsumi Hata, a student at Parsity, an online software engineering program. The work in this repository is wholly of the student based on a sample starter project that can be accessed by looking at the repository that this project forks.

If you have any questions about this project or the program in general, visit [parsity.io](https://parsity.io/) or email hello@parsity.io.

### Project Description

This simple application allows a user to store, add and search through a list of contacts.

Using React keeps various components in their own files, reducing the length of any one file.

Using Typescripts catches errors before execution.

I would like to learn about and use useContext(), useEffect(), and PropTypes.

# Contact List - Next.js Application

This project was created by **Mutsumi Hata**, a student at **Parsity**, an online software engineering program. This repository represents hands-on experience with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Next.js**, focusing on building a functional contact management application. The project is a fork of a sample starter template, expanded and enhanced through independent development efforts.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This **Next.js application** allows users to **store, add, and search through a list of contacts**, demonstrating fundamental **React Hooks**, **TypeScript**, and **Next.js routing** concepts.

### ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Server-side rendering, routing, and optimized performance.
- **React**: Modular and reusable component-based development.
- **TypeScript**: Enforces type safety and helps catch errors during development.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for layout and user experience improvements.

### ðŸ“Œ Core Features

- **Store & Manage Contacts**: Users can add, view, and search for contacts.
- **Next.js Routing**: Implements dynamic routing for smooth navigation.
- **React Context API**: Manages global state efficiently.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures reliable code execution with TypeScript.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

This project was built to deepen understanding of:

- **React Hooks**: Implementation of `useContext()`, `useEffect()`, and prop drilling solutions.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Exploring TypeScript interfaces and type safety within a React/Next.js application.
- **Next.js Features**: Routing, pre-rendering, and optimization techniques.

# Contact List

This project was created by Mutsumi Hata, a student at Parsity, an online software engineering program. The work in this repository is the result of the student's efforts, based on a sample starter project available in the repository that this project forks.

## Project Description

This simple application allows users to store, add, and search through a list of contacts.

- **React**: Used to create modular and reusable components, keeping files concise and maintainable.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety, catching errors before execution.

### Goals

- Learn and implement `useContext()`, `useEffect()`, and `PropTypes`.

## How to Run the App

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project folder: `contact-list-nextjs`.
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Planned Improvements

1. Explore and implement additional TypeScript types.
2. Add functionality to the **Edit** button for each contact.
3. Add functionality to the **Delete** button for each contact.
4. Eliminate `_20_` from the `[name]` URL for cleaner routing.
5. Use **Bootstrap** for better alignment and styling, especially for the subheader of "All Contacts."
6. Hide the **Home/Back** button on the home page.
